> #### Check out [Dark Souls III Inventory Tool](https://ds3-inventory.nyasu.business/) by sovietspaceship, a tool similar to this one, but web-based.

# DS3InventoryBuilder

This app replicates the Dark Souls 3 weapon inventory for you to preview swaps or just store weapons for your builds.
Every[\*](#known-bugs) sorting method is implemented for you to play around with, all without launching the game and bothering with any limitations therein.
It comes with an AR calculator and a rich weapon browsing tool to easily find anything most relevant for your attributes.
When you're done, save your inventory as a PNG, or encode it as text to share over chat or paste on your soulsplanner.com build.
You can import the inventory code and have your setup back any time.

## Known bugs
* Sorting by `Attack Power` is not 100% valid.
When two weapon ARs happen to be similar, DS3 applies some odd comparison rules which I haven't been able to figure out.
At times, even the DS3 ordering is wrong according to the in-game AR display (ex. weapons can be sorted as `61 > 62 > 61`).
This is rare when every weapon is fully upgraded as the damage values are more spread out, but can still happen according to my tests.
There is a in-app popup warning about this, but if you have any details on how DS3 deals with this sorting method, please let me know.

## Building
This project uses the [Conan](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html) package manager.
Since it's a Python-based tool, you might want to install it through `pip` in a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment).
1. clone and cd to repo,
1. add Bincrafters remote: `conan remote add bincrafters https://bincrafters.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/conan/conan`
1. setup CMake and dependencies: `conan install .`,
    * optionally specify compiler by adding `-s compiler=clang -s compiler.version=11`,
    * optionally specify build type by adding `--build_type=Debug`,
    * might require `--build missing` when prebuilt dependencies are not found,
1. build the project: `conan build .`,
    * add `-c` to only generate CMake files and a solution (if on Windows) without building.
